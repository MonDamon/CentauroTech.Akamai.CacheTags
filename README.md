# CentauroTech.Utils.CacheTags

CentauroTech.Utils.CacheTags helps you to add cache tags to your response header's and use it to clean up the content cached in your CDN. 

Your CDN must accept your content to be tagged before you can clean up the content by using tags.
So you'll can  mark related content with identical tags to clean up then in the future instead using CPCODE's or URL's
